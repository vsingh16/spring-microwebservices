# spring-microwebservices

By Matrin Flower:
This is a style of developing software applications as a suite of independently deployable, small, modular services in which each service runs a unique process and communicates through well defined, lightweighted mechanism(http) to serve a business goal.  

Hystrix:It provides a way to write fallback methods which will be executed in case of any fault or excpetion in  a web service, so that web service doesn't send broken response.
